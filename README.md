# Prototype AI: Multi-AI Orchestration App

> **Curious what happens when AIs talk to each other?**
> This app lets ChatGPT and Grok debate, critique, and synthesize ideas‚Äîlike a panel of digital minds, just for you!
>
> **Now modular! See `ai_engines.py`, `prompts.py`, and `ui_helpers.py` for better organization and easier development.**

## üöÄ What is this?

- An open-source Streamlit app to orchestrate conversations between multiple leading AIs: **ChatGPT (gpt-4-turbo)** and **Grok (grok-3-latest)**
- The AIs debate, critique, and build on each other's ideas over multiple rounds. At the end, you get a synthesized answer‚Äîblending their best insights.
- Use this for brainstorming, tech Q&A, or to see how two AIs can both disagree and converge!

## üöÄ What is this?

- An open-source Streamlit app to orchestrate conversations between multiple leading AIs: **ChatGPT (gpt-4-turbo)** and **Grok (grok-3-latest)**
- The AIs debate and build on each other's ideas. At the end, you get a synthesized answer, blending the best from both.
- Use this for brainstorming, tech Q&A, or to see how two AIs can disagree and converge!

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Vision

- **Multimedia Support:**  
  Enable video, audio, and image inputs/outputs, so users can interact with AIs not just via text, but also with voice, video, and other media.  
  *Imagine uploading a video or speaking your question to get a real-time AI panel debate‚Äîmaking the experience richer and more accessible to everyone.*

- **Business & Commercial Applications:**  
  This approach empowers new businesses to **leverage multiple AIs for smarter, more adaptive solutions**. Enterprises and developers can select the best AI for each use case, combine insights from different engines, and offer users true freedom‚Äî**letting anyone pick or blend the right AI at any moment**.

- **Freedom of AI Choice:**  
  Our vision is to let users orchestrate, mix, and match any number of AIs‚Äîunlocking creativity and innovation in personal and professional contexts.  
  *The future is open, collaborative, and user-powered.*

- **Scalability & Extensibility:**  
  Plans to add support for more AI engines (Claude, Gemini, etc.) and custom orchestration logic, so anyone can build their own AI ‚Äúpanel of experts.‚Äù

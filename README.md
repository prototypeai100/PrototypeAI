## üöÄ What is this?

- An open-source Streamlit app to orchestrate conversations between multiple leading AIs: **ChatGPT (gpt-4-turbo)** and **Grok (grok-3-latest)**
- The AIs debate and build on each other's ideas. At the end, you get a synthesized answer, blending the best from both.
- Use this for brainstorming, tech Q&A, or to see how two AIs can disagree and converge!
